### IR ASSIGNMENT 2

This project aims to develop a Multimodal Retrieval System that leverages the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and text process- ing techniques to analyze and retrieve relevant images and text reviews. Fo- cused on processing and comparing multimodal data (images and text) for similarity, the system performs a series of steps including image preprocess- ing, feature extraction, text preprocessing, and TF-IDF score calculation. The endeavor explores the integration of visual and linguistic content to enhance retrieval accuracy and relevance, providing insights into the effec- tiveness of multimodal data analysis.
