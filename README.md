# Multimodal Retrieval System Using InceptionV3 and NLP Techniques

## Overview

This project introduces an image retrieval system that leverages the InceptionV3 model (CNN) for extracting image features and employs NLP techniques for text analysis. Designed to facilitate the search and retrieval of images and text, this system allows for comprehensive querying across a multimodal dataset.

## Components

- **InceptionV3 Model**: Utilized for image feature extraction, generating high-dimensional vectors representing image content.
- **Text Processing Utilities**: Implements tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF computation for analyzing textual data.
- **Cosine Similarity Measures**: Computes similarity between feature vectors and TF-IDF vectors for item retrieval based on similarity to a query.
- **Data Serialization**: Manages saving and loading processed data to enable efficient retrieval operations.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, Pillow, requests, tensorflow, keras
- A dataset of images and reviews for processing and retrieval

### Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries using the command:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy nltk Pillow requests tensorflow keras
    ```

3. Download necessary NLTK datasets:

    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    ```

### Running the Application

1. The InceptionV3 model is loaded at application start.
2. For images, use `preprocess_and_extract_features` with an image URL to extract features.
3. For text, `preprocess_text` and `compute_tfidf` functions prepare and analyze text data.
4. Retrieve similar items with `find_most_similar` or `find_most_similar_reviews` based on similarity to queries.

## Functionalities

### Image Processing

- Extracts image features and processes images using the InceptionV3 model.
- Computes image similarity based on extracted features.

### Text Processing

- Cleans and prepares text data for analysis.
- Calculates TF-IDF scores for textual similarity assessment.

### Retrieval and Similarity

- Implements cosine similarity for images and text to retrieve most similar items.
- Saves and loads processed data for quick retrieval.

## Conclusion

This system demonstrates the integration of machine learning and NLP for multimedia data retrieval, offering a backend solution for applications requiring advanced search capabilities across both images and textual data.
